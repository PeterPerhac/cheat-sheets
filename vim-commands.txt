remove all blank lines
	:g/^\s*/d
remove all lines _not_ matching a pattern
	:g!/somepattern/d

can use d_ to send all matched lines to blackhole register, which will be faster



copy all lines matching a pattern into register (a)
qaq:g/pattern/y A

	here, first three commands q,a,q will clera the a register
	last command :g/pattern/y A is effectively global YANK of lines matching into register a (captial A for _appending_ into a)


=====
COPY-PASTING
=====

copying is called Yanking and so the command y is for yanking
pasting is called Pasting and so the command p is for pasting
register can be cleared by recording nothing into it, e.g. to clear the register a, type qaq
to access register a, use double quotes, e.g. to paste contents of register, use the command "ap

copy all lines matching a pattern like so:
	qaq:g/pattern/y A
optionally, open new buffer using the :new command
and paste the contents of the a register into it
	"ap

MORE EXAMPLES

to copy the current line into register k, you can type
	"kyy
Or you can append to a register by using a capital letter
	"Kyy
You can then move through the document and paste it elsewhere using
	"kp
To paste from system clipboard ("+ is the sytem clipboard register)
	"+p
To access all currently defined registers type
	:reg



to DUPLICATE A LINE use a combination of yank and paste like so:
YP
	or
Yp
	or
yyp

(yy to yank current line, Y is the same as yy)
(p pastes after the cursor, P paste before the cursor)

=====
CLOSING and (not) SAVING
=====

:w
	write current buffer to file (effectively SAVE)
:wa
	write all buffers (save all files)
:wq
	write and quit


:up
	update
:x
	update and quit

:w and :wq will always udate the timestamp, as they will always write the buffer out to the file
:up and :x will not update timestamp if there are no changes to write. Update will only write if there's any changes to update in the underlying file

mental checklist
- do I want to write the file? (w) 
- do I want to quit the file? (q) 
- do I want to quit ALL the files? (a) 
- do I want to write/abandon any changes? (!) 


ZZ	Write current file, if modified, and exit. (same as :x)
ZQ	Quit current file and exit (same as ":q!").



=====
BUFFERS
=====

:new
:ls
	list all open buffers
