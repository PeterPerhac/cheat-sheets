DANGER ZONE
===========

git checkout -- .
    this will revert your local unstaged changes - effectively checks out file from your local index into working directory, any added files not be removed by this

git reset --hard HEAD
    reverts all working copy changes to the state of files in the index at HEAD

git clean -fdxn
    throw away any untracked files/directories
    ignored files (with the x switch)
    and only do a _dry run_ (list what would be deleted), if executed witout the -n option
    -f switch requried to prevent accidental cleans

git gc --prune=now
    clean up a git repository, optionally with --aggressive switch to do a more thorough job that takes longer to perform
