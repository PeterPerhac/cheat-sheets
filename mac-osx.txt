TOP & KILLING processes
=======================
Run the `top` command, optionally with -U option to specify user, like so:
    top -U peterperhac
In order to specify primary sort, type the letter `o` , then specify the column, e.g.:
    ocpu<enter>
        to sort by cpu usage
Default sort order is -pid, that is descending sort by pid (latest processes first)

In order to kill a process, locate its PID. Type the letter `S` (signal) and then type `kill` <enter> now you will be prompted for the PID. type that and done. e.g:
    Skill<enter>5000<enter>
        to send the kill signal to PID 5000
Note that typing a lower-case `s` is used to specify the refresh rate (in seconds)
