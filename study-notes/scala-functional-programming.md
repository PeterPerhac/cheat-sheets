# Functional Programming in Scala

## What is FP

Based on a premise that we programs are constructed using only *pure functions* - i.e. functions that have *no side effects*. Functions that do something other than simply return a result is **not** a pure function.

Following the discipline of FP leads to increase in *modularity* - thus programs are easier to test, reuse, parallelize, generalize, and reason about.
