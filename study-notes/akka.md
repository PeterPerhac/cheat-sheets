Akka is:

Toolkit for highly concurrent, distributed, fault-tolerant, message-driven application on the JVM

Reactive
  - responsive: responds in timely manner
  - resilient: stays responsive in the face of failure
  - elastic: system stays responsive under varying workload
  - message-driven: system foundation for elastic, resilient responsiveness

Actors let us write code in a single-threaded illusion
No need for locks, synchronized keyword or other primitives
