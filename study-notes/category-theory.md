    define category theory

Category
    bunch of objects (not a "set" of objects)
    consists of objects

Morphism == Arrow
    between objects
objects have no properties
objects exists only to identify the ends of arrows
arrows have no properties beyond a starting and end point

a  ---->  b


category can be seen as a graph that may have infinite number of nodes / edges

g ∘ f reads as 'g after f'

if there is an arrow f connecting object a and b and an arrow g from object b to c, there must be an arrow (morphism) between a and c =>  g ∘ f
    
for _every_ object there is an identity arrow.

a function that is invertible is called isomorphism

morphism `f` from object `a` to object `b` is an **isomorphism** if there exists a morphism `g` for which these properties hold:

   g∘f = ida
   f∘g = idb

f after g is the same as identity of a
g after f is the same as identity of b
