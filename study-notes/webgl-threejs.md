# WebGL and Three.js

three components - scene, camera, renderer

If you wish to keep the size of your app but render it at a lower resolution, you can do so by calling `setSize` with false as `updateStyle` (the third argument). For example, `setSize(window.innerWidth/2, window.innerHeight/2, false)` will render your app at half resolution, given that your `<canvas>` has 100% width and height.


for drawing lines: define a material. For lines we have to use LineBasicMaterial or LineDashedMaterial.
