top OPEN a file using default application:
	xdg-open 


to fiddle with touchpad settings (finger pressure)
	xinput list
		to show all input devices
		(note the device ID for below commands)
	xinput list-props <id>
		to see all properties of given input device
		(good idea to grep for one that we're interested in)
		e.g.
			xinput list-props 15 | grep -i finger
		(note the prop id in brackets)
	xinput set-prop <deviceID> <propertyID> <newValue>
		e.g.
			xinput set-prop 15 297 30 40 100

!!! good idea to first list-props of a device into a file and keep a copy of original settings BEFORE changing these!
