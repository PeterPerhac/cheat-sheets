open .
    opens current location in Finder
cd $(dirname "$0")
    cd to the directory in which executed script resides
    relative path from current working directory to the currently executing script is available as the 0th env arugment
t7 >>out 2>&1
    sends standard output from the t7 command to a file called out, also redirects standard error to standard out, so all ends up in 'out'
find . -maxdepth 1 ! -path . ! -name "*.txt" | xargs rm -rf 
    deletes all EXCEPT the pattern *.txt
lsof -sTCP:LISTEN -iTCP:27017
	which process listens on port 27017? for ports below 1000 use "sudo"
    similarly, lists all processess listening on the TCP interface:
        lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | sort
du -cmd 1 | sort -n
	list current disk usage of files/folders in a directory, in megabytes, in ascending order
	-c to display total, -m megabytes (or use -k for kilbytes), -d (depth) followed by space 1
find
	recursively descends the directory tree for each path listed, evaluating an expression
	 find . -type f
		finds all files in current directory, equivalent of Ctrl+B in Total Commander
     find . -type f | xargs md5
        list MD5 hashes of all files under current directory
    find . -iname systemout
        finds anything (file or directory) with a name like systemout (case-insensitive)
cmd
    for fast-comapring two files, byte-by-byte, stops reading file on first mis-match and reports position of difference
    e.g. cmp raven.txt raven-huffman-decoded.txt 
md5
    calculate MD5 hash / digest / checksum of a file passed as argument
shasum
    for calculating SHA digests / hashes / checksums
        e.g. 
        shasum -a 256 /path/to/file
    or
        shasum -a 1 /path/to/file
xargs
    The xargs utility reads space, tab, newline and end-of-file delimited strings from the standard input and executes <utility> with the strings as arguments.
    e.g.
        find . -type f | xargs md5
        ls | xargs -I{} git -C {} pull
mr (non-standard)
    Multiple Repositories - initialise .mrconfig file in your $WORKSPACE by running this command:
        ls -d */ | xargs -L1 mr register
        (assumes you have cd'ed to the $WORKSPACE directory and created a blank .mrconfig file
wc
	word count - counts words, lines, characters (&bytes)
printenv
	prints out the current environment
head -10
	top ten lines
tail
    show the end of a file; e.g.:
    tail -10
	    show last ten lines of a file
    tail -10f
        follow the last 10 lines (data appended to output as the file grows)
grep
	search any given input, selecting lines that match one or more patterns
	e.g. grep -r --include="*.xml" --exclude=*target* --exclude=*idea* 'metrics' .
		this will search recursively (-r) in current directory (note the last .) looking for XML files that are NOT in .idea or target folders and contain the word 'metrics'
    -o to dump matches into the standard output
        e.g. grep -o 'HREF="[^"]\+"' bookmarks.html
            will output all HREF attributes from the bookmarks.html file
    -l only list files containing matches (not the matches themselves)
    -v inVerts the match so that only lines NOT matching the pattern are reported
    -Bn / -An will output also `n` lines Before and/or After the matched line, fore example grep -B1 9293 $WORKSPACE/service-manager-config/services.json will show the line with matching port number 9293, but also the line before it, which contains the service name assigned to the port
egrep
	equivalent to grep -E, used to specify pattern as regular expression
    no need to escape brackets and pipes in pattern
	e.g. egrep -r --include=*.java '^[Pp]attern.*$' .
fgrep
	equivalent to grep -F, used to find simple text pattern, faster than egrep or grep
cd -
	previous location
cd
	cd to home directory
which
	like windows "where"
ps aux
	process status with switches
		a, u, x
launchctl
	interfaces with launchd to manage and inspect daemons, agents and XPC services.
date
	current date
ifconfig
	network interface configuration
netstat
	network status
hostname
	current hostname
whomi
	current user
groups
	current user's groups
chown
	change owner
chmod
	change file modes
less, cat
	display to terminal
nano, vi
	edit files directly in terminal
atom
	editor
man <command>
	displays manual for given command
ls -lrt
	list files, long listing, ordered by time (reversed)
clear
	clears the screen
touch <file>
	creates a file
echo
