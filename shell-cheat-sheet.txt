!123
    execute the command number 123 from the command history
!!
    reexecute last command
xxd
    to view binary files in hex format (like Total Commander Viewer)
    use with -b option to show binary files in binary format (not hex)
nl
    number lines. This will prepend line numbers in the output.
expand / unexpand
    expand converts tabs to spaces. unexpand converts spaces to tabs.
uniq
    displays unique lines of a file
top
    like the windows task manager in the linux world
    see a pid you don't like, still within the top command use:
        k <pid>
    to kill that process
kill
    kills a process by its PID or job number
        kill 1234
            kills a process with PID 1234
        kill %1
            kills a job that has the assigned number 1
    can also be used to send various other signals to processes, using the -s option
    by default a TERM signal is sent, which is ignorable by receiving process
        kill -s 9 1234
            sends signal number 9, which is KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
open .

    relative path from current working directory to the currently executing script is available as the 0th env arugment
/bin/su -
    starts a 'clean' super user shell
    `su -` invokes a login shell after switching the user. A login shell resets most environment variables, providing a clean base.
    `su` just switches the user, providing a normal shell with an environment nearly the same as with the old user, potentially a security risk if current shell uses dangerous aliases
command > out 2>&1
    sends standard output from some command to a file called out, also redirects standard error to standard out, so all ends up in 'out'
find . -maxdepth 1 ! -path . ! -name "*.txt" | xargs rm -rf 
    deletes all EXCEPT the pattern *.txt
find . -maxdepth 1 -not -path . -not -name "*.txt" | xargs rm -rf 
    alternate syntax for the same as above, but using the -not predicate rather than exclamation mark
    negative matching on paths or names or types performed by either -not predicate or !
lsof -sTCP:LISTEN -iTCP:27017
	which process listens on port 27017? for ports below 1000 use "sudo"
    similarly, lists all processess listening on the TCP interface:

du -cmd 1 | sort -n
	list current disk usage of files/folders in a directory, in megabytes, in ascending order
	-c to display total, -m megabytes (or use -k for kilbytes), -d (depth) followed by space 1
mkdir
    makes a directory
        mkdir -p ./some/series/of/folders/that/dont/exist/
            -p option stands for Parent and will create and neccessary parent directories along the way
        mkdir -m 644 somedir
            -m option is used to set the file permission bits of the final created directory to the specified mode.
find
	recursively descends the directory tree for each path listed, evaluating an expression
    find . -type f

passwd
    passwd pperhac
        to change the password of pperhac user
cmd
    for fast-comapring two files, byte-by-byte, stops reading file on first mis-match and reports position of difference
    e.g. cmp raven.txt raven-huffman-decoded.txt 
md5
    calculate MD5 hash / digest / checksum of a file passed as argument
shasum
    for calculating SHA digests / hashes / checksums
        e.g. 
        shasum -a 256 /path/to/file
    or
        shasum -a 1 /path/to/file
xargs
    The xargs utility reads space, tab, newline and end-of-file delimited strings from the standard input and executes <utility> with the strings as arguments.
    e.g.
        find . -type f | xargs md5
        ls | xargs -I{} git -C {} pull
mr (non-standard)
    Multiple Repositories - initialise .mrconfig file in your $WORKSPACE by running this command:
        ls -d */ | xargs -L1 mr register
        (assumes you have cd'ed to the $WORKSPACE directory and created a blank .mrconfig file
wc
	word count - counts words, lines, characters (&bytes)
printenv
	prints out the current environment
head -10
	top ten lines
tail
    show the end of a file; e.g.:
    tail -10
	    show last ten lines of a file
    tail -10f
        follow the last 10 lines (data appended to output as the file grows)
grep
	search any given input, selecting lines that match one or more patterns
	e.g. grep -r --include="*.xml" --exclude=*target* --exclude=*idea* 'metrics' .
		this will search recursively (-r) in current directory (note the last .) looking for XML files that are NOT in .idea or target folders and contain the word 'metrics'
    -o to dump matches into the standard output
        e.g. grep -o 'HREF="[^"]\+"' bookmarks.html
            will output all HREF attributes from the bookmarks.html file
    -l only list files containing matches (not the matches themselves)
    -v inVerts the match so that only lines NOT matching the pattern are reported
    -Bn / -An will output also `n` lines Before and/or After the matched line, fore example grep -B1 9293 $WORKSPACE/service-manager-config/services.json will show the line with matching port number 9293, but also the line before it, which contains the service name assigned to the port
    -{n} will give you n lines of context around the matched line (same as -A3 -B3)
egrep
	equivalent to grep -E, used to specify pattern as regular expression
    no need to escape brackets and pipes in pattern
	e.g. egrep -r --include=*.java '^[Pp]attern.*$' .
fgrep
	equivalent to grep -F, used to find simple text pattern, faster than egrep or grep

        x - eXtract (unzip)
        v - Verbose - list files on screen
        f - take input from the File specified
        note that f must come last in the clump of options, as file.zip is the value of the f option
unzip -d ./output-dir/  <zip/jar/war/ear-file>
    extracts a zip file into a target directory
unzip -l <zip/jar/war/ear-file>
    lists the contents of a zip-compressed file
yes
    will repeatedly output 'y' until killed
