t7 > out 2>&1
    sends standard output from the t7 command to a file called out, also redirects standard error to standard out, so all ends up in 'out'
find . -maxdepth 1 ! -path . ! -name "*.txt" | xargs rm -rf 
    deletes all EXCEPT the pattern *.txt
find . -maxdepth 1 -not -path . -not -name "*.txt" | xargs rm -rf 
    alternate syntax for the same as above, but using the -not predicate rather than exclamation mark
    negative matching on paths or names or types performed by either -not predicate or !
lsof -sTCP:LISTEN -iTCP:27017
	which process listens on port 27017? for ports below 1000 use "sudo"

passwd
    passwd pperhac

cmd
    for fast-comapring two files, byte-by-byte, stops reading file on first mis-match and reports position of difference
    e.g. cmp raven.txt raven-huffman-decoded.txt 
md5
    calculate MD5 hash / digest / checksum of a file passed as argument
shasum
    for calculating SHA digests / hashes / checksums
        e.g. 
        shasum -a 256 /path/to/file
    or
        shasum -a 1 /path/to/file
xargs
    The xargs utility reads space, tab, newline and end-of-file delimited strings from the standard input and executes <utility> with the strings as arguments.
    e.g.
        find . -type f | xargs md5
        ls | xargs -I{} git -C {} pull
mr (non-standard)
    Multiple Repositories - initialise .mrconfig file in your $WORKSPACE by running this command:
        ls -d */ | xargs -L1 mr register
        (assumes you have cd'ed to the $WORKSPACE directory and created a blank .mrconfig file
wc
	word count - counts words, lines, characters (&bytes)
printenv
	prints out the current environment
head -10
	top ten lines
tail
    show the end of a file; e.g.:
    tail -10
	    show last ten lines of a file
    tail -10f
        follow the last 10 lines (data appended to output as the file grows)
grep
	search any given input, selecting lines that match one or more patterns
	e.g. grep -r --include="*.xml" --exclude=*target* --exclude=*idea* 'metrics' .
		this will search recursively (-r) in current directory (note the last .) looking for XML files that are NOT in .idea or target folders and contain the word 'metrics'
    -o to dump matches into the standard output
        e.g. grep -o 'HREF="[^"]\+"' bookmarks.html
            will output all HREF attributes from the bookmarks.html file
    -l only list files containing matches (not the matches themselves)
    -v inVerts the match so that only lines NOT matching the pattern are reported
    -Bn / -An will output also `n` lines Before and/or After the matched line, fore example grep -B1 9293 $WORKSPACE/service-manager-config/services.json will show the line with matching port number 9293, but also the line before it, which contains the service name assigned to the port
    -{n} will give you n lines of context around the matched line (same as -A3 -B3)
egrep
	equivalent to grep -E, used to specify pattern as regular expression
    no need to escape brackets and pipes in pattern
	e.g. egrep -r --include=*.java '^[Pp]attern.*$' .
fgrep
	equivalent to grep -F, used to find simple text pattern, faster than egrep or grep
cd -
	previous location
cd
	cd to home directory
which

    tar -zxvf file.zip
        z - it's a ZIP type archive
        x - eXtract (unzip)
        v - Verbose - list files on screen
        f - take input from the File specified
        note that f must come last in the clump of options, as file.zip is the value of the f option
unzip -l <zip/jar/war/ear-file>
    lists the contents of a zip-compressed file
zip
    zip <zipfile-name> space-separated-list-of-files-or-patterns
zipcloak
    use this to encrypt / password-protect a zip file
zipinfo
    lists the contents of a zip file along with various information about the compressed conten
    can be an easier to remember option for `unzip -l`
zipgrep
    search for text inside zipped files
    e.g.
